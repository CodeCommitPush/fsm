# FSM

A minimal, header-only Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation in modern C++.  
Lightweight, flexible, and easy to integrate into embedded or general-purpose projects.

## Features

- **Header-only**: Just include one header to use.
- **Event-driven**: Transitions are triggered by events.
- **Modern C++**: Clean, template-based design.
- **Customizable**: Extendable with state entry/exit callbacks, guards, and actions.
- **Suitable for embedded**: Designed with small memory footprint and simplicity in mind.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone or copy the `fsm.hpp` header into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeCommitPush/fsm.git
