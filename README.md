# FSM - Final State Machine 
# Description:
This repository contains a C++23 module implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) state handler. It leverages C++23 modules for improved compilation performance and code organization. The FSM is designed to handle state transitions efficiently while maintaining a modular and extensible structure.

# Features:

Uses C++23 modules for better compilation times and encapsulation.
Implements a flexible and type-safe FSM design.
Supports event-driven state transitions.
Provides an example usage scenario for demonstration.
